# Decentralized-Autonomous-Organization  DAO


In a DAO, however, this process is democratized, and any member can create a proposal, and all other members can vote on it. 

Each proposal created has a deadline for voting, and after the deadline the decision is made in favour of the voting outcome (YES or NO).


I launched a DAO for holders of CryptoDevs NFTs.
